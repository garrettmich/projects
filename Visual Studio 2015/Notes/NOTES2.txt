NOTES for battleship:

talking about int [,]
1. draw grid
2. get input
3. update grid


ARRAY:
int & string

store 0 int as string "hello"
store 1 int as string "what's up"
store 2 int as string "bleh"

if you have an integer, you can make numbers operations (multiply, divide, etc)


add one thing to user interface:
print out the messages as they are stored

(s)ave a messages - encrypt it
(r)etrieve a messages - decrypt
(l)ist storage - don't encrypt - inside your message system, you have an array. the list should print out every message

you're making a decoder, essentially.

SYNTAX:
To declare:
-String SomeFunction(string a, string b){//code}
To use:
- SomeFunction(x, y);
- Z = SomeFunction(x,y);
- Console.WriteLine(SomeFunction(x,y));

in C# you have to match it exactly. 

Example functions:
console programs are LIMITED to static

Ex.
verbs are usually functions
ask for radius
ask for color - //come up with a function to get color, etc
print buckets - //print is an action 
get cost
print cost

Functions: Main and any function you write. Some number of valuation to send and one number to come back. How many arrows go one way and whether one is coming back.

CLASSES:
-A logical arrangement of varioables and/or functions-Self Contained
-(somewhat) makes sense together
-Useful for
:Structuring data together
:Doing complex work behind function calls
:Organizing code}:Share code/functionality
:Reusing code (very easy to copy a class to a new project)


SECTIONS OF A CLASS:
-Variables (aka Members)
-Functions(aka Method)
-Members/Methods can be public or private (or protected, not used as much)
-Special Function -- Construction
:Used to initialize a class so it is ready to use
:This is what is called when you say class something = new class();


TO USE:
-Classes must be instantiated, often with "new" before being used 
:(Remember our Random class for random numbers)
-Looks just like any other vaiable:
:SomeClass myClass = new SomeClass();
:myClass.someFunction();// this calls the function that you declared in SomeClass
